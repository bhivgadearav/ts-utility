![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@aravbhivgade/ts-utility) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

A utility package for TypeScript designed to simplify common operations on objects. This package enhances code readability and reduces boilerplate code in TypeScript projects by providing several helpful functions.

## Overview of Features

### 1. Pick
**Purpose**: Easily create new objects with selected properties from an existing object.  
**Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where you only need a subset of properties from a larger object.

### 2. Make Partial
**Purpose**: Generate objects where all properties are optional.  
**Use Case**: Useful in cases where you want to create configurations or update functions that don't require all properties to be provided.

### 3. Make Readonly
**Purpose**: Create an immutable version of an object.  
**Use Case**: Ensures that your object cannot be modified, preventing accidental changes.

### 4. Create Record
**Purpose**: Create a new object where keys are from an array, and all values are set to a fixed value.  
**Use Case**: Handy for initializing state or creating lookup tables.

### 5. Exclude From Union
**Purpose**: Filter out specific items from an array.  
**Use Case**: Useful for managing lists where certain items need to be excluded based on user input or conditions.

### 6. Create Map
**Purpose**: Transform object values into a new structure using a mapping function.  
**Use Case**: Ideal for converting data formats or applying transformations to each value in an object.
